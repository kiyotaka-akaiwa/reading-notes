### Chapter 2 - The Phychological Principles of Decision-Making

Most human oddities boil down to survival

**Cognitive Bias** - Tendency to think a certain way as a result of past experience.
 - **Framing Effect** - Cognitive bias in which the reaction depends on the presentation of the situation
 - **Availability Heuristic** - Tendency for humans to make a quick decision based on what is easy to recall
 - **Confirmation Bias** - Tendency for humans to look for information that is consistent with its beliefs

Psychological States
 - Fatigue - He is more optimistic and is likely to overestimate his chance of succeeding
 - Hunger - He is more likely to take risky decision-making
 - Urge to Urinate - He is more likely to make risky decision

External Factors
 - Temperature - Warmth makes a person more trusting and generous up to a certain point. When it gets too hot, a person will become angry
 - Brightness - Brightness intesifies the feeling.
 - Peer Pressure - People tends to yield to other. Ambiguity and size of people can affect this.

 Emotion-based phish -> Creates responses in brain and body -> Emotion takes over logic -> Lack of reason leads to bad decision -> Impulsive or emotional behavior takes place

**Amygdala Hijacking** - **Amygdala** is a area in a brain where it processes stimuli and send it to other part of the brain to be handled. Amygdala Hijacking is when Amygdala starts making decision based on emotion rather than rational.
Amygdala Hijacking can be fixed by taking some moment to relax before making a decision.

5 Steps for a Good Decision-Making
 1. Make sure to understand the problem
 2. Collect information completely
 3. Consider viable options
 4. Make decision
 5. Evaluate


### Chapter 3 - Influence and Manipulation

Influence is positive and Manipulation is negative. Most decisions lies in-between theses 2.
 - **Rapport** - Ability to build a relationship with another person. It is necessary for Influence but not for Manipulation

Training should primarily use influence as manipulation can cause psychological damage. However, real-world attackers will be using manipulations.

Deception - Can either be an influence or manipulation.
Punishment - Manipulation that compels the target into desired behaviors as a result of negative consequences.

Influence
 - **Reciprocity** - Pervasive belief that people deserves to be paid for what they do.
 - **Obligation** - Influence through customs, manners, feelings, and roles.
 - **Concession** - When the target yields once, he tends to continue to yield.
 - **Scarcity** - Making something look more rare.
 - **Authority** - Power to make decision, such as legelity, charisma, or credibility
 - **Consistency and Commitment** - After a person stepped over a behavioral boundary, they are more likely to complete the chosen course.
 - **Liking** - People tend to like people that likes them, and are similar to them
 - **Social Proof** - Human's natural tendency to look to others to guide their behaviors in an ambiguous situations

Providing any reason increases the chance of the request to be accepted

Manipulation
 - Increase susceptibility
 - Environmental control
 - Forced re-evaluation
 - Removal of power
 - Punishment
 - Intimidation


### Chapter 4 - Lessons in Protection

#### Lesson One: Critical Thinking

Critical Thinking - To not accept everything at face value
 - Does the email come from someone I know?
 - Was I expecting this email?
 - Are the requests reasonable?
 - Does the email employ emotional content?
 - Does the email try to get me to take an action?

Attacker will use Amygdala Hijacking to stop the targets from thinking critically.

#### Lesson Two: Learn to Hover

Hovering over a link will show the URL the link will redirect to.
However, sophisticated attacker can defeat this hovering, so it is important to double check the URL after accessing the website.

If you noticed that the website is malicious after clicking, think back what the email was asking you to do. If it was asking for a credential, change all account that uses the same credential. If it was asking to install a program, clean your computer and change all accounts from another clean computer.

Attacker may compromise mail servers to send out phishing email from legitimate address.

#### Lesson Three: URL Deciphering

Attackers can buy domains that look legitimate or that looks closely linked.

#### Lesson Four: Analyzing E-mail Headers

Although email headers contain valuable information about phishing, attacker can gain access to legitimate computers and send emails from a legitimate email.

#### Lesson Five: Sandboxing

**Sandboxing** - Creating an environment where one can run untested codes

Some malwares can bypass sandbox.

What not to do
 - Copy and paste the URL - Although it is viable, there are many factors of it going wrong, and it is not worth the risk.
 - Forwarding potential phishing email - Forwarding emails online spreads the phishing email
 - Open attachment in phone - Contrary to popular belief, many malware exists for phones as well
 - Fully rely on AV - Antivirus cannot stop all virus


### Chapter 5 - Plan Your Phishing Trip: Creating the Enterprise Phishing Program

Motivation for a phishing program
 - Compliance
 - Increase Security Awareness
 - Recent Experience in Security Incident
 - Part of Penetration Test

Themes
 - Generic (Don't spend too much time)
 - Media/News
 - External - Attackers research third party vendors to create a more sophisticated phishing email.
 - Internal (Start simple and gradually make it more difficult) - Attackers can use URL similar to corporate URL

Whether it is legal for adding real logos to a phishing email remains controversial.
It is important to consult the company lawyer if it is okay.

Phishing Program
 - Setting a baseline
   - Warned Baseline - Let the target know that phishing program is starting. 
   - Surprise Phish Baseline - Start sending phishing email without letting them know
 - Setting the difficulty level
   - Level 1 - Easy to identify, such as 419 scam
   - Level 2 - A little more sophisticated, but not personal
   - Level 3 - Personalized with brandings
   - Level 4 - Spear Phishing
 - Writing the phish - Don't make it too sensitive
 - Tracking and statistics - Choose a tracking software based on the statistics you want
   - Number of people who clicked
   - Number of people who reported the phish
 - Reporting - Explain why the phishing program is worth the investment
 - Repeating

**BEST Method**
 - Brief
 - Effective
 - Simple
 - Thoughtful


### Chapter 6 - The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Policies and More

Policy must be properly and appropriately.
The boss cannot be exempt from the phishing program. 
Phishing program must involve everyone in the company.
Phishing education must occur repeatedly
Make it easy to report phishing emails.
Don't make a limitation on the day not to phish.
Don't have the target delete the phishing email. Have a place to report them.
